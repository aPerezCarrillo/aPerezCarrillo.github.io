            <h2>Data Science Team Lead | Audio&Music Technology | Natural Language Processing | GenAI | ML <p> Passionate on leveraging AI to create a positive impact in world and society.</h2>
            <p>With over 15+ years of experience spanning academia and industry, 
I am a dedicated professional at the intersection of music technology, data science, and artificial intelligence. My journey began with a PhD and postdoctoral work in audio signal processing and machine learning, where I honed my analytical skills and developed a deep understanding of innovative technologies.
<p>
Transitioning from academia, I spent five transformative years in data science, focusing on natural language processing (NLP) for diverse sectors, including developing a search engine and understanding unstructured medical records in healthcare. 
<p>  
Currently, I lead a dynamic Data Science team in the digital marketing space, where I specialize in NLP and Generative AI, driving projects that enhance user engagement and deliver actionable insights. 
<p>      
Beyond my professional life, I am an active violinist, merging my passion for music with technology by building prototypes that enhance violin performance using micro-controllers. I also practice Ashtanga yoga, which fuels my commitment to mindfulness and well-being. 
<p>      
As I look to the future, I am eager to pivot my career towards AI for Good initiatives, focusing on areas such as climate change, education, health improvement, disaster response or community empowerment. I thrive in leadership roles, fostering a positive team culture that encourages creativity, collaboration, and productivity. I am driven by curiosity and a desire to contribute to a better world through technology and teamwork. Letâ€™s connect and explore how we can leverage AI to make a meaningful difference!
